        <p>
          Hello, the following are the terms of service for using <i>Community Builder</i>.
        </p>
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>
          The secondary purpose of this service is to grow a community through anonymous connections.
          The primary reason for <i>Community Builder</i> is to aggregate a conversational database to be used in junction with the machine learning chatbot service.
        </p>
        <h4>Usage</h4>
        <p>
          <i>Community Builder</i> will be used strictly in Discord's direct messages.
          To begin, use <span>&excl;cb</span>, you may end the session with <span>&excl;cb stop</span>.
          ReinaBot will connect to another user anonymously; when you send a message in the direct message channel, ReinaBot will relay the message to the other user (vice versa when receiving).
          Stopping a session will notify both parties of the terminated session.
          If a session is started without closing the previous session, the previous session is automatically closed, and the end recipient of the previous session will be notified about the closure being due to a new conversation being started.
          <br />
          As this is a public service there are guidelines to follow:
          <ul>
            <li>Please follow the Discord Terms of Service, if a conflict arises between Discord's Terms of Serice and ReinaBot's, Discord's Terms of Service hold more power and thus overrules these terms of service</li>
            <li>No pornographic/sexual content, especially underaged pornographic content is absolutely not tolerated</li>
            <li>Discussion of politics and terrorism should be kept to a minimum, ideally avoided in all circumstances (remember, the bot will be learning off conversations)</li>
            <li>Harassment of any type is not tolerated (i.e. racism, sexism, ageism, etc. - the list does not stop here, just because it is anonymous to the users, does not mean information is completely out of reach for any party)</li>
            <li>This service is not to be used for commercial gain; advertising and promotion of products are frowned upon</li>
            <li>Please remember even if connections at first are anonymous, ReinaBot cannot guarantee the security of your messages; be cautious in sending messages containing any personal or sensitive information</li>
          </ul>
          <b>A violation of the above guidelines will result in removal from the service and a permanent ban with no chance of repeal.</b>
        </p>
        <h4>Data</h4>
        <p>
          When using <i>Community Builder</i>, you agree to allow ReinaBot to collect your chat conversation and store such data indefinitely.
          Your conversations may be monitored to make sure they are following the guidelines stated above and also do not contain personal information.
          ReinaBot will try its best not to aggregate personal information (i.e. names, addresses, financial information, phone numbers, etc.), but please note that not all detection mechanisms are perfect.
          If you believe <b>anybody</b>&apos;s personal information has been stored and you wish to remove it, please email me <a href="mailto:the2gnows@gmail.com">here</a> with your Discord username and tag (e.g. pinnouse#7766) along with the message you believe contains the sensitive information.
          By using the <i>Community Builder</i> service, you agree to these terms; you are allowing ReinaBot to keep a record of your conversational history for learning purposes and your information will not be shared without the consent of the aggregator.
